# Quant Model Comparison Website

Welcome to the repository for the **Quant Model Comparison Website**! This project allows users to visualize, compare, and contrast predictions for a single stock symbol across multiple quantitative models. Whether you’re a data scientist, quant enthusiast, or just curious about financial forecasting, this tool makes it easy to examine how different models perform on the same data.

## Overview

Modern quantitative finance often involves testing multiple forecasting methods on historical data to see which performs best. This website streamlines that process by:
- Providing a user-friendly interface
- Displaying predictions from various quant models side-by-side
- Enabling visual and statistical comparisons

By making these comparisons more accessible, it’s easier to identify model strengths, weaknesses, and applicability.

## Features

- **Model Predictions**: Visualize daily, weekly, or monthly forecasts from each model.
- **Interactive Plots**: Zoom in and out of the data range for better inspection.
- **Statistical Metrics**: Quickly see error metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) for each model.
- **Easy Comparison**: Toggle models on or off to simplify your view.
