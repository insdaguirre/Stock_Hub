1Precompute + cache warming
Add /api/precompute?symbols=AAPL,MSFT,... that enqueues jobs; trigger it nightly via GitHub Actions to keep artifacts and Redis warm.
2Frontend env and deployment hygiene
Remove hardcoded API fallback; build with REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL only and document the dev/prod values.
3 Observability and alerts
Structured logs (request/job IDs, durations, cache hits).
Basic counters (AV calls, cache hit rate, job durations).
Alert on worker failures and high error rate.
